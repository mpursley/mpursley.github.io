# SRE Best Practices Handbook

## I. Introduction & Core Principles

### 1. What is SRE?

*   Definition of Site Reliability Engineering
    *   Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that applies software engineering principles and practices to operational and infrastructure problems.  It focuses on automating tasks, building resilient systems, and preventing incidents to ensure high availability, performance, and reliability of services.  SRE teams use tools and technologies like monitoring systems, automation scripts, and infrastructure-as-code to manage complex systems and resolve issues proactively.    
*   Distinction between SRE and DevOps
    * Site Reliability Engineering
        * **Focus:** Ensuring the reliability, performance, and availability of systems and applications.
        * **Approach:** Applies software engineering principles to solve operational and infrastructure problems.
        * **Responsibilities:**

*   Defining clear on-call rotations and escalation policies.
*   Handover criteria (when a service is ready for SRE support).

## II. Key SRE Practices & Areas

### 3. Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Error Budgets

*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Define meaningful SLOs based on user journeys and business impact (not just technical metrics).  Start with availability and latency.
    *   Use Service Level Indicators (SLIs) to measure SLOs.
    *   Establish Error Budgets (1 - SLO) = allowable unreliability.
    *   Track Error Budget consumption and use it to make data-driven decisions about release velocity and risk.
    *   Regularly review and refine SLOs as the service evolves.
    *   Clearly define consequences of exceeding the error budget (e.g., feature freeze).
*   **Recommended Tools:**
    *   Prometheus: For defining and tracking SLIs.
    *   Grafana: For visualizing SLOs, SLIs, and Error Budgets.
    *   Sloth: For generating Prometheus SLO rules from a simpler specification.
    *   Keptn: For quality gates and automated remediation based on SLOs.

### 4. Monitoring & Observability

*   **Best Practices:**
    *   The Four Golden Signals: Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation.  Ensure these are tracked for *every* service.
    *   RED Metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration): A concise subset of the Golden Signals, excellent for dashboards and alerts.
    *   USE Method (Utilization, Saturation, Errors): More focused on system resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, network).  Important for capacity planning.
    *   Distributed Tracing: Essential for understanding the flow of requests through microservices.
    *   Log Aggregation and Analysis: Centralized logging for troubleshooting and post-mortems.
    *   Metrics, Logs, and Traces should be correlated: Link them together for faster debugging.
    *   Synthetic Monitoring: Simulate user interactions to proactively detect issues.
    *   Real User Monitoring (RUM): Monitor the actual experience of users in their browsers.
*   **Recommended Tools:**
    *   Prometheus: Time-series metrics collection.
    *   Grafana: Visualization and dashboarding.
    *   Loki: Log aggregation (from the LGTM stack).
    *   Tempo: Distributed tracing (from the LGTM stack).
    *   Jaeger: Distributed tracing.
    *   OpenTelemetry: A unified standard for collecting telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces).  Highly recommended for new projects.
    *   Fluentd/Fluent Bit: Log collection and forwarding.
    *   Elasticsearch/OpenSearch: Log storage and search.
    *   k6: Load testing and performance monitoring.

### 5. Alerting

*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Alert on Symptoms, not Causes: Focus on user-facing impact (e.g., "high error rate for checkout service") rather than internal metrics (e.g., "CPU utilization > 90%").
    *   Avoid Alert Fatigue:  Alerts should be actionable and require human intervention.
    *   Prioritize Alerts: Use severity levels (e.g., page, warning, info).
    *   Use Alert Routing and Escalation Policies: Ensure the right people are notified at the right time.
    *   Document Alert Runbooks: Provide clear instructions for responding to each alert.
    *   Regularly Review and Tune Alerts: Eliminate noisy or unnecessary alerts.
    *   Alert on SLO breaches: This is a crucial connection to your error budget.
*   **Recommended Tools:**
    *   Prometheus Alertmanager: Alerting based on Prometheus metrics.
    *   Grafana Oncall: On-call scheduling, escalation, and incident management.
    *   PagerDuty: Incident management and alerting platform.
    *   Opsgenie: Incident management and alerting platform.

### 6. Incident Management

*   **Best Practices:**

    *   Automate Incident Response Where Possible: Use tools to automate tasks like paging, creating incident tickets, and gathering diagnostic information.
    *   Focus on Mitigation, not Blame: The goal is to restore service as quickly as possible.  Blameless post-mortems are crucial.
    *   Communicate Clearly and Frequently: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the incident.
    *   Document Everything:  Timelines, actions taken, root cause analysis.
*   **Recommended Tools:**
    *   Grafana Oncall: (As mentioned above)
    *   PagerDuty/Opsgenie: (As mentioned above)
    *   Jira/Confluence: For documenting incidents and post-mortems.
    *   Slack/Microsoft Teams: For communication during incidents.
    *   [Statuspage.io](http://statuspage.io/): For communicating incident status to users.

### 7. Post-Mortem Analysis

*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Blameless Post-Mortems: Focus on identifying systemic issues and preventing future incidents, not assigning blame.
    *   Structured Post-Mortem Process: Use a template to ensure all relevant information is captured.
    *   Identify Contributing Factors:  Use techniques like the "5 Whys" to drill down to the root cause.
    *   Action Items:  Assign clear action items to prevent recurrence, with owners and deadlines.
    *   Share Post-Mortems Widely:  Promote learning across the organization.
*   **Recommended Tools:**
    *   Confluence/Google Docs: For documenting post-mortems.
    *   Jira: For tracking action items.

### 8. Release Engineering & CI/CD

    *   Rollback Strategies:  Have a plan to quickly revert to a previous version if something goes wrong.
